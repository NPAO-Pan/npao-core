Core Foundry VTT functions common to the NPAO campaigns.
Backlog:

- Camping module: vista POV, incorporate dailies, sunset/sunrise darkness automation, watch orders, red glowing eyes for trouble. Clock ticking monotonously.
- Roll in Narrator and Monk's Chat Timers
- Return to development of LNPCs
- Shop prefabs
  // Under development:
  // \* Extension of exclusive audio to support constant objects (to stop or otherwise act on) with multiple players - 27 Oct plan: add/remove objects to a flag or other registered global
- Improve Level Up Wizard & add settings option to enable/use
